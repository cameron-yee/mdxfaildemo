The **BSCS 5E Instructional Model** has its origins with the work of earlier science educators, in particular the Karplus and Thier learning cycle developed for the Science Curriculum Improvement Study (SCIS). The findings reported in the National Research Council research summary How People Learn supports the design and sequence of the BSCS 5E Instructional Model. Since the late 1980s, BSCS has used the 5E Instructional Model extensively in the development of new curriculum materials and professional learning experiences. The BSCS 5E Instructional Model also enjoys widespread use beyond BSCS: multiple states strongly endorse using the BSCS 5E Instructional Model, and there is ubiquitous use of the model for curriculum frameworks, assessment guidelines, or course outlines; curriculum materials; and teacher professional learning.
