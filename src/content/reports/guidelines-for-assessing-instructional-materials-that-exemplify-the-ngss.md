<p className="mb-2">The Guidelines Summit took place May 15-19, 2015, at Cheyenne Mountain Resort in Colorado Springs, Colorado. The project was funded by a grant from the National Science Foundation in response to the National Research Council publication, Monitoring Progress to Successful K-12 STEM Education. This document identifies 14 indicators as large-scale national measures of the health of STEM education in U.S. schools. In particular, the Guidelines Summit responded to Indicator 4, which calls for guidelines for developing measures that assess how well widely-used science instructional materials embody the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS).</p>

### The goals of the Summit were to

<Card className="bg-light" style={{ marginBottom: "3rem" }}>
  <Card.Body>
    <ol>
      <li>engage leading science educators in building consensus on the criteria to include in a process and tools that evaluate the extent to which science instructional materials embody the NGSS, and</li>
      <li>produce a set of Guidelines based on this consensus for the development of the process and tools.</li>
    </ol>
  </Card.Body>
</Card>

Eighteen science educators from across the country participated with BSCS staff in discussions at the Summit. Additional attendees included two facilitators and a project evaluator.

The Guidelines for the Evaluation of Instructional Materials in Science found here can be downloaded free of charge by all who are interested.
