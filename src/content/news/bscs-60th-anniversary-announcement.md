Dear Friends,

For BSCS, 2018 is an especially exciting year—it marks the 60th anniversary of our storied organization.

We have a rich history. Over 60 years of working to transform science teaching and learning, our impact has expanded considerably. From our origin as a single curriculum development project called the Biological Sciences Curriculum Study, we have grown into an independent nonprofit organization—recognized as a national leader in research, teacher professional learning, leadership development, and of course, instructional materials.

Today, I am pleased to announce a new name for our organization that reflects our present and our future.

**We are now BSCS Science Learning**.

We are putting science learning at the heart of our name because science learning is at the heart of our work.

As researchers, we pursue deeper understandings of how teachers and students learn science through ongoing studies. As educators, we prepare teachers to improve their practice by enhancing their own science learning and by offering powerful curriculum materials. As capacity builders, we develop leaders to create a stronger system for science learning.

And as an organization, we remain committed to transforming science education so that all students have an opportunity to learn science for their lives and careers.

We are proud of what we have accomplished over the last 60 years. And we are excited about our future as BSCS Science Learning.

On behalf of our board and staff, thank you for your steadfast friendship and support.

Sincerely,
