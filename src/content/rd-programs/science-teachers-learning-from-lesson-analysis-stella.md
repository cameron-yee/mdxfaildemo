STeLLA is a nationally-recognized program for teacher professional learning—developed from a 16-year line of research at BSCS Science Learning. 

**The STeLLA Approach**

STeLLA brings together two powerful approaches to teacher professional learning. What teachers learn in STeLLA is a set of **high-leverage teaching strategies**, identified through research on the instructional practices of highly effective science teachers. How teachers learn in STeLLA is through **video-based lesson analysis**, in which they study videos of teachers attempting to implement the STeLLA teaching strategies. The combination—learning to use high-leverage STeLLA teaching strategies through video-based lesson analysis—transforms teaching and learning.

**Powerful Across Contexts**

STeLLA is proving to be powerful across contexts. STeLLA has proven effective in both teacher preparation (preservice) and continuing education (inservice) programs; in district-wide programs and in programs enrolling individual teachers; in programs for elementary, middle, and high school teachers; and in programs facilitated in person and online. 

**Growing Line of Research**

The findings on the STeLLA approach are compelling. Where most studies of teacher professional learning only show effects on the participating teachers, studies of STeLLA show major impacts on both teachers and students.

**Work with Us**

High quality science education is more important than ever. Teachers must prepare students to succeed in a 21st century society, where scientific reasoning and critical thinking skills are essential. To prepare teachers to achieve this goal, BSCS is working to bring the STeLLA approach to teachers nationwide through partnerships with schools, districts, teacher educators, and funders.
