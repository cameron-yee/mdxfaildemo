#### The Issue
Racism is a serious problem in the United States. Research has shown that the biology curriculum can affect how students think about race. It can lead students to believe more strongly in three misconceptions<sup>(4-5, 7-8)</sup>:

1. People of the same racial group are genetically uniform.
2. People of disparate races are categorically different.
3. Biologically-influenced abilities cannot change.

Individuals often justify racism with these misconceptions by arguing that it is pointless to try and reduce social inequality, because race biologically determines ability<sup>(6)</sup>.
<br />
<br />
#### Our Focus
How can such beliefs be (un)learned through biology education?
<br />
<br />
#### What We’ve Learned
**Teaching about human difference is not socially neutral**.

Insights from our research have begun to illustrate how biology education affects the development of racism, for better or worse. We’ve learned:

* When biology education causes youth to perceive too much genetic variation between racial groups, it can increase prejudice.
* Conversely, the way we teach biology can reduce racial prejudice by helping students understand that there is more genetic variation within racial groups than there is between them.

In sum, the humane genetics research project is beginning to suggest that genetics education can create humane or inhumane outcomes depending on how it addresses human difference. If this hypothesis is correct, then learning about the social and quantitative complexities of human genetic variation research could prepare students to become informed participants in a society where human genetics is invoked as a rationale in sociopolitical debates concerning racial inequality.

At present, genetics education does very little to address how information about human genetic difference is distorted by racialist ideologues <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/17/us/white-supremacists-science-dna.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(The New York Times)</a>. Instead, our scholarship suggests that genetics curricula could actually contribute to harmful racial ideologies <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/09/teaching-race-high-school-biology-textbooks/570319/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(The Atlantic)</a>. The kind of genetics education that we envision would promote human welfare by exposing the scientific flaws in biological justifications of racism and sexism. Our research and development explores how to bring that kind of education into existence.
