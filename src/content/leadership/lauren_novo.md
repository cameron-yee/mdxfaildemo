### *Director of Communications & Advancement*

**Lauren Novo** joined BSCS as the Director of Communications & Advancement in August 2017. With nearly a decade of communications agency experience, she has represented brands ranging from global tourism destinations and Fortune 500 companies to national sports brands and nonprofit organizations.

Her career in communications has consistently intersected with science and research.

While serving as the public relations representative for Aruba, Lauren promoted the Caribbean island's green energy plan and sustainability efforts - successfully landing exclusive coverage across Bloomberg, CNBC, and The Wall Street Journal. During her time in sports PR, she explored and communicated everything from concussion research to myofascial release techniques. But her passion for the nonprofit sector began while spearheading communications efforts for Kidz1stFund, a nonprofit dedicated to finding a cure for Fanconi anemia. It was personally fulfilling to translate medical advancements into national media exposure, contributing to the organization's larger goals of raising research funding.

Lauren is eager to leverage her expertise in strategic planning, partnership development, media relations, creative and technical writing, and event planning to help BSCS expand its impact and influence on science education.

Lauren graduated summa cum laude from Florida State University with dual B.A. degrees in communications and creative writing. Born and raised in Florida, she is finally fulfilling her lifelong dream of living in Colorado. She spends her spare time running half marathons, hiking beautiful mountains and trails, and rooting for the Denver Broncos.
