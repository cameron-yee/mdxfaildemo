### *Senior Research Scientist*

**Dr. Chris Wilson** joined BSCS as a Research Specialist in July 2007 and is currently a Senior Science Educator. His ongoing research interests include the development and application of learning progressions in grades K–16 science education; patterns in reasoning with scientific models of systems across grades K–12 students, undergraduate science majors, secondary science teachers, and university science faculty; the development of pedagogical content knowledge in preservice science teachers; reform in undergraduate science education; environmental science education; and decision making with respect to socio-scientific issues.

Chris has worked on numerous professional development projects, addressing issues from science teachers’ content knowledge, problem-based learning, and mentoring preservice interns. He has taught undergraduate ecology, evolution, genetics and introductory biology courses, as well as science methods courses for secondary preservice science teachers.

Prior to joining BSCS, Chris was a visiting assistant professor in the Center for Curriculum Materials in Science in the College of Education at Michigan State University. In that position, his research focused on model-based reasoning in undergraduate biology education, and the development of grades K–12 learning progressions toward environmental science literacy.

<p style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">He holds a B.S. in Zoology from the University of Liverpool in England, an M.S. in Zoology specializing in Evolutionary Biology and a Ph.D. in Zoology specializing in Informal Science Education in Zoos from Michigan State University.</p>
