### *Division Director, Research*
### *Senior Research Scientist*

**Dr. Sue Kowalski** joined BSCS as a Science Educator in May 2007. She is currently the PI for an NSF-funded research and development project, designing and studying an online professional development course for teachers. In collaboration with Oregon Public Broadcasting, the National Renewable Energy Lab, the Great Lakes Bioenergy Research Center, the National Teachers Enhancement Network of Montana State University, and RMC Research Corporation, we are developing an online course to enhance teachers’ content knowledge and practice associated with fundamental energy concepts. Sue is also a lead researcher on an NSF-funded project to establish power analysis parameters for science education research proposals.

Sue taught high school science for 10 years in Bloomington, MN. While in Bloomington, she taught a sheltered physical science course for English Language Learners, general and AP physics, and all levels of physical science. Sue was also an active member of her teachers’ union, serving on the contract negotiations team for six years. She has presented papers at the National Association for Research in Science Teaching (NARST) conferences, and at the American Educational Research Association (AERA) conferences. Her primary research interests relate to teaching science for both excellence and equity.

Sue received a B.A. in Physics from Colorado College, and an M.A. and Ph.D. in the department of curriculum and instruction of science education at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. Her dissertation examined the intersection of race and gender in high school physics’ group work conversations. Her hobbies include keeping up with her two small children, gardening, canning, running, biking, swimming, choral singing, and reading.
