Allergies affect more than 50 million Americans, and are among the leading causes of chronic disease in the US. One in every 13 children, roughly two students in every classroom, have allergies to food.


To help middle school teachers more effectively teach about food allergies, BSCS Science Learning has developed an online curriculum supplement called Allergies & Scientific Inquiry. Students using this multimedia resource learn how to distinguish food allergies from other negative food reactions. They explore the role of the immune system in causing allergy symptoms and learn how medical research is contributing to better allergy management.


Lessons engage students in the practices of scientific inquiry, and are aligned to the Next Generation Science Standards. Teachers can access instructions for navigating the classroom lessons once logged into the teacher portal.


Is this the right resource for your classroom? Hereâ€™s a sample of what students will learn:

* Allergies involve inappropriate reactions of the immune system.
* Scientific medical diagnosis of food allergies is critical.
* The main management option for people with food allergies is avoidance.
* The management of food allergies is improved if people know how to correctly read food labels. Access Resource
* Individuals with food allergies should not be stigmatized.
