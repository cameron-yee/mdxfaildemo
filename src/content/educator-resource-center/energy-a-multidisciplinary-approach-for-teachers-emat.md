_Do we need more wind farms? Should I buy solar panels for my roof? Is my lifestyle contributing to climate change?_ These are relevant questions in today’s world. And the ability to answer them depends on an understanding of energy.

That’s why BSCS Science Learning developed EMAT. This online resource helps teachers frame complex energy concepts in a way that will resonate with high school students and prepare them to participate in important societal conversations. 

Teachers can freely access 30 science content animations and 20 interactive learning experiences to enhance student learning in the classroom.
