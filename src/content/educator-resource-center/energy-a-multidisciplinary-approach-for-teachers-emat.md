_Do we need more wind farms? Should I buy solar panels for my roof? Is my lifestyle contributing to climate change?_ These are relevant questions in today’s world. And the ability to answer them depends on an understanding of energy.

That’s why BSCS Science Learning developed EMAT. This free online course helps teachers frame complex energy concepts in a way that will resonate with high school students and prepare them to participate in important societal conversations. Supporting both teacher and student learning, EMAT includes six units: Coal, Nuclear Energy, Wind, Geothermal Energy, BioFuels, and Solar Energy. These units feature 34 engaging classroom videos, 30 content animations, and 20 interactive learning experiences.
