Why is citizen science important? Not only does it allow communities to play a role in advancing scientific knowledge, it empowers individuals of all ages to make meaningful observations and learn about their natural environments. BSCS Science Learning’s interactive platform called FieldScope is transforming the way educators, community members, and organizations engage in citizen science. 

With FieldScope, teachers and students can participate in a variety of projects ranging from supporting amphibian conservation by reporting on calls of local frogs and toads to monitoring plants in their own school gardens. Participants conveniently upload to a shared project database the measurements, observations, and media they gather outdoors. Project organizers and community participants can then leverage sophisticated graphing and mapping visualization tools to gain broader perspectives on the environment.

FieldScope is freely available to educators, students, and community members who wish to participate in existing projects or launch new ones.
