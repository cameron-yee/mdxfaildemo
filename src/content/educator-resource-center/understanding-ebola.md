## Understanding Ebola

In 2014-15, more than 11,000 people died in an outbreak of Ebola in West Africa. And just a few years later, the Democratic Republic of Congo is experiencing a world-first: an Ebola outbreak in a war zone. Citizens around the globe continue to share concerns about the spread of this disease.

BSCS has developed a free resource to educate the public about Ebola. The website—Understanding Ebola Virus Disease—includes an interactive model that allows teachers, students, and community members to actively explore the factors that influence a disease’s spread and mortality rate.

In alignment with the Next Generation Science Standards, the resource addresses selected disciplinary core ideas, science practices, and crosscutting concepts."
