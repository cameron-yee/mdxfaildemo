Building upon the success of the BSCS Science: An Inquiry Approach high school program, BSCS Science Learning has developed and field tested* a multidisciplinary science program for middle school students. 

BSCS Middle School Science is a standards- and inquiry-based program comprised of four units: Earth/Space Science, Life Science, Physical Science, and Science and Society. Designed for maximum flexibility, the units are grounded by the BSCS 5E Instructional Model and can be adapted for various teaching styles and classroom settings.  

The curriculum is available free online for teachers who agree to provide usability data and complete student pretests and posttests. Click below to register for resource access.
