Children are naturally inquisitive. That is one of the many reasons why it is important to engage students in science at a young age. With access to a high quality science education, students can channel their curiosities to help make sense of the world around them.

BSCS Science Learning’s elementary program allows preK through grade 5 students to interact like scientists, participating in inquiry-based activities while also developing important reading, writing, and critical-thinking skills. BSCS Science Tracks: Connecting Science & Literacy offers four modules—life science, earth & space science, physical science, and science & technology—for each grade level.

BSCS recently revised two units* to align with the Next Generation Science Standards. All units are available for purchase through the Kendall Hunt Publishing Company.
