Research shows that students have difficulty understanding chemical reactions at an atomic or molecular level, and struggle with applying chemical concepts to biological systems.

BSCS Science Learning has developed and field tested a curriculum unit to provide students with a better foundation for high school biology. Through 19 carefully sequenced lessons and activities, Toward High School Biology: Understanding Growth in Living Things helps middle school students connect core ideas about chemical reactions to the biological phenomena of growth and repair in plants and animals. This curriculum supports the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS)â€”using LEGOs, ball-and-stick models, videos, and a variety of print manipulatives to support students in developing evidence-based explanations.  

Toward High School Biology, Student Edition is available for purchase through NSTA Press. It should be used in conjunction with the Teacher Edition, which provides complete lesson plans and instructions for carrying out the activities. Complimentary video demonstrations and tutorials are also available online.
