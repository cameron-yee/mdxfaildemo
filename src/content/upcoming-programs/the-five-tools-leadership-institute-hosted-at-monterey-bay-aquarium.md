At this Institute you will learn how to help teachers plan for instruction and classroom assessment based on the new science standards and _Framework for K-12 Science Education_. Discover an effective pathway at the Five Tools Leadership Institute.

<a href="https://www.amnh.org/learn-teach/curriculum-collections/five-tools-and-processes-for-ngss" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Five Tools and Processes&nbsp;<sup><i style="font-size: .65rem;" class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></sup></a> is the translation of science concepts, practices, and performance expectations into multiple instructional sequences that form an NGSS unit. This is followed by a more in-depth plan for one instructional sequence and assessment task to provide evidence of student learning focused on performance expectations. These processes help teachers plan for conceptual coherence.
