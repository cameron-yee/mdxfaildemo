How can you help teachers plan for instruction and classroom assessment based on the new science standards and _Framework for K-12 Science Education_? Discover an effective pathway at the Five Tools Leadership Institute.

At the heart of the Five Tools and Processes is the translation of science concepts, practices, and performance expectations into multiple instructional sequences that form an NGSS unit. This is followed by a more in-depth plan for one instructional sequence and assessment task to provide evidence of student learning focused on performance expectations. These processes help teachers plan for conceptual coherence.

#### Details:

* Dates: April 28 - May 3, 2019
* Location: Monterey Bay Aquarium, 886 Cannery Row, Monterey, CA, 93940
* Cost: $1,000 per team plus $200 per person, minimum two-person team / maximum five-person team, lunch will be provided during meeting times, travel costs are not included in the registration fee

**Goals and Outcomes**

* develop a deeper understanding of NGSS and the Framework for K-12 Science Education;
* learn how to design and plan three-dimensional, phenomena or problem-driven units of instruction; and
* access facilitation guides and other resources to help you navigate the Five Tools model of professional development.
